# LFCA

LFCA is a small client-side quiz application. It provides practice questions for the Linux Foundation Certified IT Associate (LFCA) topics grouped by category (Linux, System Administration, Cloud, Security, DevOps, IT Project Management). Questions are stored as JSON files under `src/data` and are loaded dynamically when a user selects a category. The app offers per-question feedback, explanations, keyboard accessibility, and simple navigation (first/prev/next/goto/last).
